            <!-- * what is the project * -->
            <p>This project was for a university assignment where we had to create a Java Swing Portfolio. The work was done during workshops and at home where we did weekly task requirements.</p>

            <!-- week 1 -->
            <p>During the first week, we had to create setup and initialize User Data from a csv file, create a basic main viewer window to display the content, and implement an edit button so the name could be replaced. This week was to teach us the basics about Java Swing and how we can read and write to files. There were also extra tasks to do during this week where if we wanted to expand our skills, we could add a User Name tab for the name edit panel, and add an additional tabbed panel for data inside the csv file. All this was so we can learn how to structure a clean UI to navigate and keep tidy.</p>

            <!-- week 2 -->
            <p>During the second week, we setup ActionListeners so when we pressed the edit buttons, it would display a dialog box with a text box for us to edit the name in. We had to make sure that the Action Preformed correspond with the name that is attached to it. Once the new name was added, we had to refresh the window in order to display the new name. The extra tasks for this week were to update the model so that any changes to the files will show up on the program and to implement an edit functionality to all the tabbed panes so the user is able to edit all the info within the csv files. </p>
